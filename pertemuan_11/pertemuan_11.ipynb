    "- With this definition we understand that feature have a **large variation in intensity in all the directions** on image.<br><br>\n",
    "- At the below of image, six small image patches are given. \n",
    "- Question for you is to find the exact location of these patches in the original image. \n",

    "- C and D are much more simple. \n",
    "    - They are **edges** of the building. \n",
    "    - You can find an approximate location, but exact location is still difficult. \n",
    "- E and F are some corners of the building. \n",
    "    - And they can be easily found. Because at the **corners**, wherever you move this patch, it will look different.\n",

    "    - If you move it in vertical direction (i.e. along the gradient) it **changes**. \n",

    "- And for **red patch**, it is a **corner**. \n",

    "- Once you have found it, you should be able to find the same in the other images. \n",
    "- How is this done? We take a region around the feature, we explain it in our own words, like \"upper part is blue sky, lower part is region from a building, on that building there is glass etc\" and you search for the same area in the other images. \n",
    "- Basically, you are `describing the feature`. \n",
    "Similarly, a computer also should describe the region around the feature so that it can find it in other images. So called description is called **Feature Description**. \n",
